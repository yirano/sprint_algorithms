#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) `O(n)` - This will take on the order of _n_ number of operations to complete. 


b) `O(n log n)` - This one almost tricked me but the `while` loop can quickly catch up dependent on the `j` value, meaning that whatever that value is can quickly shift the runtime of this algorithm. It's kind of like searching through a binary search tree.


c) `O(n)` - This will take on the order of _n_ number of operations to complete.
